![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/ROSMASTERX3-PLUS/blob/main/Yahboom_ROSMASTERX3_PLUS.jpg)
# Introduction
ROSMASTER X3 PLUS is an omnidirectional movement robot developed based on the ROS robot operating system. It supports four contollers: Jetson NANO 4GB/Xavier NX/TX2 NX and Raspberry Pi 4B. It is equipped with high-performance hardware configurations such as lidar, depth camera, 6DOF robotic arm, 520 high-power motor, voice recognition interactive module, and HD 7-inch display screen. It can realize applications such as APP mapping and navigation, automatic driving, human feature recognition, moveIt robotic arm simulation control and multi-machine synchronous control. It supports mobile phones, handles, computer keyboards remote control. 124 video tutorials with Chinese and English subtitles and codes are provided for free.
# Features
* Reasonable design, unique shape
1) X3PLUS supports four development boards: Jetson NANO 4GB/Xavier NX/TX2 NX/RaspberryPi 4B, suitable for different users.
2) The whole robot is made of green aluminum alloy material, which is safe and non-toxic, beautiful and durable.
3) Mecanum wheel and pendulum suspension chassis can make the robot adapt to uneven ground.

* Top-level hardware configuration
1) YDLIDAR 4ROS high-performance lidar: It adopts TOF ranging method, Anti-glare(100Klux), scanning radius up to 30m, which can be used for indoor and outdoor mapping and navigation.
2) Astra Pro depth camera: You can manually adjust the tilt angle of the camera to achieve depth image data processing, 3D navigation and mapping and other AI visual functions.
3) 6-DOF bus servo robotic arm: with joint angle readback function, support moveIt simulation.
4)Voice interaction module: Using USB serial communication, it can recognize human voice and respond with voice.
5)HD touch 7-inch screen: You can debug the robot, enter ROS system and install software anytime and anywhere without a computer.

* ROS operating system, a variety of functions
1) Using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS +ROS Melodic operating system, Python programming.
2) Mapping navigation, multi-point navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance and follow.
3) RTAB-Map 3D visual mapping and navigation, ORBSLAM2+Octomap mapping, depth image data point cloud image.
4) Human feature recognition and interaction, URDF kinematics simulation, garbage identification and sorting, and automatic driving to clear obstacles.
5) MediaPipe develops realize hand and facial gesture detection, AR tag recognition, and target tracking.
